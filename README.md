This is a attendance tracking website designed to be incredibly simple and intuituve but still be quite feature-rich. Essentially, organization leaders/staff can create a tracker with a unique code that students/members enter on the website. If they have signed in before, they can just search and select their name, and if they haven't they just have to type out their name and then hit the "Join" button.

The names will pop up on the staff's screen and they can also see who is absent based on other people who have joined.

There is a stats page where users will be able to view stats for everyone who has joined at least once. We currently have two clubs/organizations who are using this system to track attendance.

The backend utilizies the firebase auth for login/logout and email verification/password reset. We used deta (a NoSQL database) to store users attendance data.)
